## About
This lab is based on Qwiklabs Supported by [Google Cloud Platform(GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/).

In this lab, I build and evaluate a simple linear regression model in TensorFlow using the Esitimator API to predict AAPL stock prices.

[Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/keras_model_to_estimator?hl=en) are a part of the high-level TensorFlow APIs which are interchangeable and allow users to test many standard pre-made estimators models in quick succession.
