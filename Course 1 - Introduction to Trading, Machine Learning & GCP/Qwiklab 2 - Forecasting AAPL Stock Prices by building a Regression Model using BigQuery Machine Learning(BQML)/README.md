## About
This lab is based on Qwiklabs Supported by [Google Cloud Platform(GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/).

In this lab, I build and evaluate a simple linear regression model in BQML to predict AAPL stock prices.

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is Google's fully managed, NoOps, low cost analytics database. With BigQuery you can query terabytes and terabytes of data without having any infrastructure to manage, or needing a database administrator.

[BigQuery Machine Learning](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml-analyst-start) (BQML) is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.
